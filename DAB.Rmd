# Introduction

The dataset contains information about bank customers. The goal is to predict whether a customer will close his credit card account, in that case the bank may try to propose more convenient services and prevent the client from leaving the bank.

```{r}
Data = read.csv2("./Dataset/bank_accounts_train.csv", 
                 header = T,

This is a paragraph in an R Markdown document.

Below is a code chunk:

```{r}
fit = lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
b   = coef(fit)
plot(cars)
abline(fit)
```

The slope of the regression is `r b[1]`.
